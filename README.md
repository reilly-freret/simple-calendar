Creative Portion
First we chose one basic one from the website,
We added 3 different filters, School, Work, and Personal
Users can tag their events with these filters and toggle which to display on the calendar.

Then, We then spent time learning Twilio SMS Api  and using help from the documentation and built a feature where if you click event details. You can input your number, click Text Me! and it will send you a text message of your event name, event date, and time. Making it super easy to keep track of your event if you want to move it to mobile.

Thank you!
